This project contains all files necessary for the vector control of an induction motor
A breif description of the files
Vector_Control_double_work_motor_n :: prog.c contains the entire vector control code
seperate_files_n :: The vector control code is divided into modules
float_*, int_* :: The modules used in the vector control code

Folders further added on
seperate_files_n_2 :: Major Change in makefile. No of slices reduced by approx 20%
Vector_Control_double_work_motor_n_2 :: Added latency for motor.
